\title{Detect if a request comes from htmx}
\usage{
htmxr_is_htmx(request)
}
\arguments{
\item{request}{A request object (e.g. from a plumber2 handler). Must have
a \code{headers} element — a named list or character vector of HTTP headers
(lowercase keys, as provided by plumber2).}
}
\value{
\code{TRUE} if the request was made by htmx, \code{FALSE} otherwise.
}
\description{
Checks whether the incoming HTTP request was made by htmx by inspecting
the \code{HX-Request} header. htmx sends this header with every AJAX request.
}
\examples{
# Simulated htmx request
req <- list(headers = list(`hx-request` = "true"))
htmxr_is_htmx(req)

# Regular request
req <- list(headers = list())
htmxr_is_htmx(req)

}
