Description: A lightweight framework for building server-driven web
    applications in R. htmxr combines the simplicity of htmx for partial
    page updates with the power of plumber2 for non-blocking HTTP
    endpoints. Build interactive dashboards and data applications without
    writing JavaScript, using familiar R patterns inspired by Shiny.
